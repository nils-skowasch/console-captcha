# Console Captcha

This fun program was created for the [Laurie Wired Programming Challenge 2024](https://github.com/LaurieWired/Halloween_2024_Programming_Challenge). 

It brings the well-loved Captcha requests to the Terminal world. The program is written in C++ on Linux Mint 21 and can be compiled with g++ (see the [Makefile](./Makefile)).
